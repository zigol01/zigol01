# About me
![Avatar](/images/avatar.png "My avatar")
I'm a self-taught programmer mainly using Unity and C#.
I started making games when I was 8 using Windows Batch and Visual Basic using tutorials from youtube. 
Then I started learning about web development (HTML, CSS, PHP, JS) and finally became more interested in becoming a REAL game developer. 
Now for 4 years I have been learning how to use the Unity engine. I made the game ["Potężniak"](https://gamejolt.com/games/potezniak/473059) and in the near future I plan to create another game and release it on Steam.
